Streaming
Streaming lets you subscribe to updates of the agent run as it proceeds. This can be useful for showing the end-user progress updates and partial responses.

To stream, you can call Runner.run_streamed(), which will give you a RunResultStreaming. Calling result.stream_events() gives you an async stream of StreamEvent objects, which are described below.

Raw response events
RawResponsesStreamEvent are raw events passed directly from the LLM. They are in OpenAI Responses API format, which means each event has a type (like response.created, response.output_text.delta, etc) and data. These events are useful if you want to stream response messages to the user as soon as they are generated.

For example, this will output the text generated by the LLM token-by-token.

Run item events and agent events : 
RunItemStreamEvents are higher level events. They inform you when an item has been fully generated. This allows you to push progress updates at the level of "message generated", "tool ran", etc, instead of each token. Similarly, AgentUpdatedStreamEvent gives you updates when the current agent changes (e.g. as the result of a handoff).


For example, this will ignore raw events and stream updates to the user.



| Type                        | Level           | What It Means                                 | When You Use It                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Item Events**             | 🔹 *Low-level*  | Token-by-token updates (each word/character)  | For **real-time text streaming** (like a chatbot typing effect) |
| **RunItemStreamEvents**     | 🔸 *Mid-level*  | Full message or tool completion               | For **progress tracking** or structured logs                    |
| **AgentUpdatedStreamEvent** | 🔺 *High-level* | Active agent changed (handoff between agents) | For **multi-agent systems** or UI showing “who’s in control”    |
